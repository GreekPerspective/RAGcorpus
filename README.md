# RAGcorpus
 The Ancient Greek corpus RAG (a sample from Thucydidesâ€™ History of the Peloponnesian War) is manually annotated with  speech, attitude and perception reports.


We present the REPORTS annotation scheme in the guidelines and an accompanying list of verbs and annotation decisions.

You can view the RAG corpus online here: http://applejack.science.ru.nl/brat/#/Thucydides/ThucydidesQ

or you can download the raw BRAT annotation files in the zip file.
