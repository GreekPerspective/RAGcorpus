# RAG corpus

The Ancient Greek corpus RAG (a sample from Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War) is manually annotated with speech, attitude and perception reports. The research is supported by the EU under FP7, ERC Starting Grant 338421-Perspective.

We present the REPORTS annotation scheme in the paper below and a more detailed version including certain decisions that we made in the manual. We also provide an accompanying list of embedding entities and their (default) classification rules we used.

You can view the RAG corpus online here: http://applejack.science.ru.nl/brat/#/Thucydides/ThucydidesQ

Alternatively you can download the raw BRAT annotation files in the zip file.
